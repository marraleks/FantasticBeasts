            School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he was sorted into Hufflepuff House. While at Hogwarts he was
            sentenced to expulsion, though Albus Dumbledore, who had been his Defence Against the Dark Arts instructor
            and recognised his innocence, objected strongly.</p>

          <h4>What is a beast</h4>
          <p>«The definition of a ‘beast’ has caused controversy for centuries. Though this might surprise some
            first-time students of Magizoology, the problem might come into clearer focus if we take a moment to
            consider
            three types of magical creature.
            Werewolves spend most of their time as humans (whether wizard or Muggle). Once a month, however, they
            transform into savage, four-legged beasts of murderous intent and no human conscience.
            The centaurs’ habits are not human-like; they live in the wild, refuse clothing, prefer to live apart from
            wizards and Muggles alike and yet have intelligence equal to theirs.»

          <h4>The book</h4>
          <p>The book ‘Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find’ is a copy of Harry Potter's textbook that was written by
            Newt
            Scamander, a magizoologist and fictional character from Series. The book has the same name as previously
            mentioned in the first novel of Harry Potter series, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. The book is a
            part of syllabus of first year Hogwarts students.

            The books holds information about mysterious animals or beasts, their lifestyle, habits with special
            section
            about what not to feed or be careful about when dealing with or handling any beast. While the book takes
            you
            to a journey across five continents in quest to find magical beasts, the handwritten detailing and comments
            by Harry, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley on their personal experiences adds light humour to the
            background.</p>
